# Indian-Festive-Sales-Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from E-Commerce channels during Indian festivals. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook containing Python code that reads, cleans, and visualizes the sales data. Various parameters such as gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, product category, and specific products are explored to gain insights into festive sales patterns.

## Project Information

* The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle.
* Operations performed in the notebook include data loading, data cleaning, and visualization.
* Python libraries used:
  * Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
  * Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
  * Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
  * Numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for arrays and matrices.

## Instructions
1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`

2. **Importing the Data**: Ensure that the dataset **(Indian Festive Sales Data.csv)** is located in the appropriate directory. Use the provided Python code to import the data into the notebook.

3. **Running the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook **(Indian Festive Sales Analysis.ipynb)** in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Execute each cell sequentially to run the code and generate visualizations.

4. **Exploring the Analysis**: Review the analysis and observations made in the notebook based on different parameters such as gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, product category, and products.

5. **Saving Changes**: If you make any modifications to the dataset or analysis, save the DataFrame to reflect the changes in the CSV file **(Indian Festive Sales Data Clean.csv)**.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals insights into festive sales patterns, highlighting the preferences and behaviors of different demographic groups during Indian festivals.
